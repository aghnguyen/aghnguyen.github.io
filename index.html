I am a psycholinguist deeply interested in understanding how people can shape the conversations they participate in. My work sits at the intersection of linguistic representation and spontaneous communication, with much of my work exploring how conversational effects arise from the interaction of semantic, pragmatic, and contextual factors. I employ a variety of methods in my work, including experimental methods, corpus analyses, and qualitative methods, as well as collaborating with psychologists across subfields, linguists across subfields and scholars in neighboring fields, such as computer science.

I hold a B.S. in Cognitive Science from UCLA, a MS in Psychology (Cognitive) from UCSC, a MA in Linguistics from UCSC, and a PhD in Psychology (Cognitive), also from UCSC.
